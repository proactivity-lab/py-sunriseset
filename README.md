# py-sunriseset
Python code for calculating the sunrise and sunset at a specific location on a specific day.

Implementation is based on algorithm from:
```
	Almanac for Computers, 1990
	published by Nautical Almanac Office
	United States Naval Observatory
	Washington, DC 20392
```



**!!! Edge cases need to be tested and checked !!!**

Currently days that only have a sunset or a sunrise, but not the other, will seem to have neither.
Differences with timeanddate.com can be quite significant sometimes ... reason has not been investigated.
